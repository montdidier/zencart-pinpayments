		<p><strong>Before you proceed, make a backup of your database. Installation is done at your own risk.</strong></p>
                <p>Unzip the files from &quot;files&quot; directory to your computer. Connect to your server via FTP. Simply upload all file from "new_files" directory to your store root</p>
                <p>One required core file was modified (ajax.php). You can just replace the file according to your version of Zen Cart, or merge the changes.</p>
                <p>One core file was modified (admin/orders.php) to allow issuing refunds directly from the admin section. Uploading this file is optional since refunds can also be issued from the Pin Merchant Dashboard. Make sure you use the file that matches your Zen Cart version. In case you have made any changes to this file, make sure you merge it carefully (you can use a tool like <a href="http://winmerge.org/?lang=en" target="_blank">WinMerge</a>). All changes have been commented. Otherwise, you can simply overwrite.</p>
<p>After all files are in place, log in to your admin section and go to admin-&gt;Modules-&gt;Payment, locate "Pin Payments", click on it and click the &quot;install&quot; button on the right. Enter your Transaction Key (obtained from Pin Payments), change other settings as required and click "update".</p>
<p><strong>In case installation fails to add required database tables</strong>, you will have to install the tables manually. Log in to your admin section and go to Tools->Install SQL Patches. Open the "mysql_updates/pin_payments.sql that comes with this plugin, copy the content, paste it in the admin section and click the "send" button. <strong>NOTE: </strong>do NOT do this if you're not getting an error message instructing you to do that.</p>
<p>Your module is now installed and ready for use.</p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind this module requires a secure connection (SSL certificate) to work.</strong></p>
